Once you have Borealis in your system, there are some things that need to be into consideration for first time users:

* It's a scripting focused language.
* It's a loosely typed language with strong typing support.
* Braces are always mandatory for control structures and such.
* It includes four data types `number`, `string`, `table` and `function`.
* It has different operators for different data types (like `^` for concatenation and `eq` to compare values as strings).
* Functions are first-class citizens.
* The ternary operator is replaced by a standard function called `t`.

It's recommended to follow the documentation pages in the following order:

1. Basic syntax
2. Types
3. Control structures
4. Operators
5. Constants/Variables
6. Functions
7. Standard library and other pages...
