The standard object `Error` gives you multiple values related with error codes.

It also includes a `last` property which includes the code of the last error (usually generated by a built-in function in Borealis). This property is initialized to `null` and can be modified by the user since it's not a constant.

## Constants

Keep in mind that all the error constants are of type `number`.

The error constants usually refer internally  to a C value defined in the errno header file.

| INTERRUMPED    | Interrupted system call.           | EINTR         |

## Examples

This code will print the string 'Error' if the file does not exists:

```borealis
Os.remove('not_existing_file.txt');

if (Error.last == Error.NOT_ENTRY) {
    printLine('Error');
}
```

This code will print 'Too long' if the given path to the `isFile` function is too long:

```borealis
Error.last = null;

Os.isFile(too_large_path);

if (Error.last == Error.NAME_TOO_LONG) {
    printLine('Too long');
}
```
