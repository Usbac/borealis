The standard table `Error` gives you multiple values related with error codes.

It also includes a `last` property which includes the code of the last error (usually generated by a built-in function in Borealis). This property is initialized to `null` and can be modified by the user since it's not a constant.

The functions of the standard library that modify the `last` property are listed below:

* `File.create`
* `File.read`
* `File.write`
* `File.append`
* `File.copy`
* `File.getType`
* `File.getSize`
* `Os.isFile`
* `Os.isDir`
* `Os.exists`
* `Os.rename`
* `Os.remove`
* `Os.makeDir`
* `Os.chmod`
* `Os.chown`
* `Os.getPermissions`
* `Os.getModTime`
* `Os.getChangeTime`
* `Os.getAccessTime`
* `Socket.new`
* `Socket.send`
* `Socket.recv`
* `Socket.bind`
* `Socket.listen`
* `Socket.accept`
* `Socket.close`
* `Socket.shutdown`
* `Socket.getOption`
* `Socket.setOption`

## Constants

Keep in mind that all the error constants are of type `number`.

The error constants usually refer internally to a C value defined in the errno header file.

_Keep in mind that the C counterpart name could vary across different systems._

## Examples

This code will print the string 'Error' if the file does not exist:

```borealis
Os.remove('not_existing_file.txt');

if (Error.last == Error.NOT_ENTRY) {
    printLine('Error');
}
```

This code will print 'Too long' if the given path to the `isFile` function is too long:

```borealis
Error.last = null;

Os.isFile(too_large_path);

if (Error.last == Error.NAME_TOO_LONG) {
    printLine('Too long');
}
```
