## Code of conduct

Before making a contribution to the project, please read the following points and be sure to follow them:

* Avoid being harsh and using bad language.
* Don't be discriminatory.

Any behavior that can be qualified as harassment won't be tolerated.

## Making a contribution

### Pull request

### Issue

* Make sure that the same issue does not exists before making a new one.

    * What are the steps to reproduce?
